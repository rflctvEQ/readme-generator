## Description 
This command line application generates README.md files. This is done using the ```inquirer``` npm package to create a form for the user to fill out, and then the user input is rendered to a newly created markdown file using JavaScript.

## Installation

Then type ```npm i inquirer```. You should now be able to use this app. See the next section for usage instructions. 

## Usage 
To use this app, change directories in the command line to the 'readme-generator' folder. Then type ```node index.js``` and fill out the form submission. After completing the form, the generated README.md file is created in the 'readme-generator' folder.
