## Description 
This is a test, therefore there is no need for a detailed description. Nevertheless, I wrote this description to show off my README generator. Without a description of some length, it would be difficult to see how polished the README produced really is. That is the reason for this nonsensical description.

## Installation 
You need to download the npm package called “inquirer.” After downloading the readme-generator folder, open the command line and change directories to the folder. Type ```npm i inquirer```. Once you’ve done so, you’re good to go!

## Usage 
To use the app, change directories to the readme-generator folder in your command line. Then simply type ```node index.js``` and follow the resulting prompt.
